    <h4>Image1: Haluski - Cabbage and Noodles</h4>
    This simple recipe came from the Polish side of my family. We simply called it 'cottage cheese and noodles' or 'lazy man pierogies.' It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. It could be a side dish, but we always enjoyed it as a meal.



    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>  1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li> ½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until softened, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.</li>
        <li>  Stir butter and onion mixture, cottage cheese, sour cream, sea salt, and black pepper into the noodles. Place the pot over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through and warm, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
